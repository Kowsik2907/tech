    <p>A simple trick can cure your addiction to social media

        My phone has hacked my attention. No matter where I am or what I'm doing — brushing my teeth, watching TV, or crossing a street — I find myself incessantly scrolling and tapping on my phone. When I do manage to put it down, I pick it up again a few minutes later. And once I pick it up, I get sucked in: I unlock my phone to check the weather, and somehow I end up on Instagram for half an hour. Most of the time, I don't even realize that I'm doing it.</p>
